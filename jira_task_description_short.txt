Address Normalizer - Test Execution

Run test suite for address normalization API.

Test Files:
- Main file: Output/przypadki_testowe_automation.csv (1,167 tests)
- Simple version (no probabilities): Output/przypadki_testowe_automation_simple.csv (1,167 tests)
- Full docs: Output/przypadki_testowe_kompletne.csv (649 tests)

Test Types:
- Ambiguity: 637 tests (54.6%) - same street name as square, same city name in different places
- Wrong matches: 149 tests (12.8%) - when system picks wrong address
- Bad combinations: 180 tests (15.4%) - wrong input combinations
- Street prefixes: 97 tests (8.3%) - handling ul./al./pl. in street names
- Formatting: 65 tests (5.6%) - data format checks
- Building numbers: 13 tests (1.1%) - number validation
- Other: 26 tests (2.2%) - API tests, edge cases

Priority: High (671), Medium (308), Low (146), Highest (42)

Main Test Areas:
1. Ambiguity: Same city name in different places, same street name as square (ul. vs pl.)
2. Street prefixes: Street name with/without prefix (ul. Marszałkowska vs Marszałkowska)
3. Wrong matches: Similar city names, popular street names in many cities
4. Input types: Street+City+Postal (710), Street+City (349), Full address (100)

What to Check:
- All 1,167 tests run successfully
- API returns correct values in EXPECTED_* fields
- Ambiguity cases handled correctly
- Street prefixes removed in output (ul./al./pl. not in result)
- Errors handled properly

Notes:
- Tests sorted by Category → Priority → TC_ID
- Variants (TC-XXX-N) are extra tests for ambiguous cases
- Based on real Polish address data (ULIC, TERC, SIMC)
